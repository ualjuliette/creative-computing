# creative-computing
I will admit when I first saw the title of our next section, "creative computing", my first reaction was one of aversion. I was not in the right headspace for math or science of any kind. I had never been very adept at these subjects in high school, although I did find myself enjoying them on the occasion that I had actually understood what I was lerarning. I would like to point out, however, that I do not want to be one to perpetuate the scientific vs artistic stereotype, nor the gender stereotypes that are associated with it, but I simply lacked the confidence in those areas. I respected and admired them, but never really imagined myself engaging with them proprely. That was where lied the problem. Because I did not consider myself to be the "math" or "science" type, I had closed myself off to the idea of computing entirely, without having tried it. Major faux pas. Like with anything in life, "don't knock it till you've tried it". 

The part where my perspective changed, was in realising the first word: creative. Creative computing. It kind of sounds nice and catchy together, perhaps due to the alliteration of the "c". Computing by itself does have a level of mysticality and obfuscation to it, which can make it quite an alienating subject. Conaeuqently, it is not something incorporated into traditional educational structures, so I guess it was normal of me to have the intial reaction that I had (mind you, it was the same one I had when we were first introduced to the "computational thinking" Friday lectures). Pairing the concept of computation with design relieved some of my internal stressors about how "unfit" I was for this subject. I learned that art and design have as much a place in the computation field as science, technology, engineering and math (STEM).
