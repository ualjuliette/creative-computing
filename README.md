# creative-computing
I will admit when I first saw the title of our next section, "creative computing", my first reaction was one of aversion. I was not in the right headspace for math or science of any kind. I had never been very adept at these subjects in high school, although I did find myself enjoying them on the occasion that I had actually understood what I was lerarning. I do not want to be one to perpetuate the scientific vs artistic stereotype, nor the gender stereotypes that are associated with it, but I simply lacked the confidence in those areas. I respected and admired them, but never really imagined myself engaging with them proprely. That was where lied the problem. Because I did not consider myself to be the "math" or "science" type, I had closed myself off to the idea of computing entirely, without having tried it. The part where it all changed, was the first word: creative. Creative computing. It kind of sounds nice and catchy together, perhaps due to the alliteration of the "c". Computing by itself does have a level of mysticality and obfuscation to it, which can make it quite an alienating subject. Conaeuqently, it is not something incorporated into traditional educational structures, so I guess it was normal of me to have the intial reaction that I had. Mind you, it was the same one I had when we were first introduced to the "computational thinking" Friday lectures.
